ArtBrush FontKarate was created back in 1992. I worked at a newspaper and we needed a stylic special font for advertisement purposes. I found this typeface in an old type book from back in the 40s. I had it scanned, then later manufactured a font from the scans.Enjoy this freeware font!If you like this font, send me a postcard telling me.Gary D.
